Exploring Economic Inequality and Its Impact on Career Choices

This project investigates how economic inequality influences university students' choice of career paths, specifically the preference for technical versus non-technical majors. Inspired by stereotypes linking technical roles to less affluent backgrounds, the study analyzes data collected via a survey from undergraduate students at leading Pakistani universities. Exploratory data analysis revealed that students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more inclined toward technical majors, though technical fields are dominant across all income levels. A logistic regression model validated these findings, achieving a high accuracy of 90.91%. The research highlights the role of economic disparities in shaping academic and career decisions, advocating for interventions to promote equality in education and employment opportunities.
